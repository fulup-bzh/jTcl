jTcl is a tool box for designing application WEB server in TCL with a
JAVA syntax. it use 100% vanilla TCL , does not require any extension
and run any tclsh supported plateform including W95. Demonstration
should run just out of the box, let me know in case of trouble.

Tool box provides:
===============
 -  a JAVA like object and syntax approach, jTcl parse JAVA-TCL code at
    startup time, thus making performance very close of conventional TCL
    code.

 -  a C/C++ to TCL module, to add C/C++ libraries as component under tclsh,
    skeleton are provides for Linux/Aix/Soloris/SunOS/VxWorks/NT.

 - debug facilities that automatically trace code at execution (strace
   like) depending on a debug matching pattern.

 - A Serialization mechanism for not loosing time to store your
   application configuration.

 - A package mechanism reproducing java import functionality

A Class Library with classes for:
========================
 - Generic TCP client/server, provides basic mechanism as client min/max
   client authentication, etc.

 - Conventional WEB server, supports all basic mime type
   html,gif,jpg,class, etc.

 - Application WEB server,  a specific mime type (htcl)  parse html page
   and interpret <tcl=..> tag before sending data, this reproduce CGI
   functionally without CGI.

 - A session server, for each new user login this server start a new
   slave interpreter. Then at each HTML <form> validation all parameters
   from HTML <form> are transfer to slave interpreter before calling
   procedure attached to HTML page. This mechanism allow a clean
   separation between application logic and HTML presentation.

 - A rule server, allows an automatic TK update for a client connected
   on it. Application is decomposed in a hierarchical tree of elemental
   constrains. Then at each validation client send query and server
   return update. Client is a "very light" model and don't have any
   application logic. Even libel text from widgets come from server
   allowing language fly translation.

Demonstration
===========
   - a chat server
   - a WeB server that parse embedded tcl in html pages
   - a  WeB server that create a slave interpreter at each new client
     login it handle a small address book where addresses are serialized
     on disk at user logout.
   - a rule client and server that support both French and English
     language.

Which file ?
===========
   -  https://github.com/fulup-bzh/jTcl
      Everything you need to run demo and build application (TCL only)

   -  https://github.com/fulup-bzh/jWrap
      jWrap (a C/C++ wrapper for jTcl) for Linux X86/RH5.0 (TCL+elf)

   -  https://github.com/fulup-bzh/jCommon
      all Makefile skeleton, mandatory to recompile jWrap (TCL+Elf binaries)
